# Oblivion Beta
A standalone combat system built on the Mudlet client that assists you with the complex combat dynamics of Avalon, and makes your life easier by handling many things such as affliction curing, bashing triggers, defence defup and keepup, among many other features. It's great for combat beginners who don't have to worry about memorizing all the possible afflictions, cures, and what it looks like when you receive them - to combat veterans who can optimize the system for their style.

Best of all, it's free, open-source, and reliable.
